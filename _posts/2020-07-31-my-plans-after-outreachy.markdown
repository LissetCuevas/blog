My internship is near to end and is time to talk about what I'll do after it ends. The internship ends exactly at August 18th. 

I'll graduate in 2022, and I'll back to classes at the end of September but due to COVID-19, the next semester will be only too. Besides my next semester will be with few charge. I'll look for a part time job, in Mexico City or remote, that would be easy as I have 3 months experience. My native language is Spanish and I'm fluent in English. And I'm open to be a self-employed contractor. 

I'm also open to a Volunteer remote position because what I want immediately is to continue working in the software field, continue learning and developing my soft and hard skills.

Of course, I want to continue with my Software path career. I'm studying Telematics Engineering where I learn about telecommunications and informatics (for that reason my career is of 5 years). This give me also the opportunity to apply to TI jobs, and I understand many things about nets, internet, telephony and data transmission, I really enjoyed when I learnt all that things but what I most like is the software. But understand all this things, help me to understand better and have another view in the software field.
During my internship I had the opportunity to work with all the project parts: planning, designing, frontend, backend and also help to devolepe my soft skills. And I have done little projects with Android, Django, Java, C, Frontend (JS, HTML, CSS) and now Perl.

During my internship I learnt that working with a new programming language isn't difficult when you now about the field. I made all the project with Perl that at the beginning was totally unknown to me. So I can adapt easily an in general I can say that I'm a fast lerner. 

But due to COVID-19, may be will take more time to find a job so while I look for, I will continue contributing to Mozilla and maybe explore other communities and may be other languages. And also I want to do an Algorithms Online Course.

Besides I want to participate in another internship the next summer. So I'll start to looking for opportunities and applications in September.
