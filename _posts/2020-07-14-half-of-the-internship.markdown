After a beginning where I though that I was doing everything wrong, the time goes so fast, and now I'm at half of the internship with good progress, and feeling really more confident. 

Originally in my application I only recorded in my project timeline the time that my mentors and I would be able to work, because part of my internship was to define the project plan.
 
But due to COVID-19 my school schedule was shifted, and Outreachy allow us to work only 10 hrs/week during classes. So since the beginning of the internship while I worked defining the Product Specifications, my mentors and I considered that I'd be working less time for a long period and we limit the scope of the project.

So basically the tasks of the project were divided in 3 parts: write the Product Specifications, develop the Bugzilla Extension to register webhooks, and develop the webhooks Push Connector (the actual part that manage the requests). The limitations were in the specifications of the webhooks, in general all the product will be done.

Until now I've accomplished the first two tasks (with some minor details) and right now I'm working on the third task, that I think is the more hard and it will take me more time. But that is right, because I have already enough time to work on it because I still have half of the internship and I'm starting working full time.

At the beginning it was planned done first the push connector and then the extension but while I was starting, the first time, with the push connector I realized that I needed the resources from the extension to correctly test the push connector, so I told it to my mentors and the plan change to first make the extension and then the push connector.

And it really helps because I feel the push connector as a more difficult task, and have made the extension first helps me a lot to understand better the way that Bugzilla Code is done and works. And also by this time of the internship I've learnt to manage my time better, to ask questions and to resolve my self questions so much better than at the beginning. And have a task completed made me rely so much more on myself and feel capable to accomplished this harder task.

So far I've learnt a lot in all the fields. I feel more confident talking in English, in the meetings, asking in the chats, have faced different kind of problems and got help and solved it by myself.
 
So I have good expectations of myself and of the internship for this second half. I think I'm going to accomplished the goals but also now I know that sometimes there are things that takes more time than we expect and if that happens I'll be ready to manage it.
